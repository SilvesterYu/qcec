Welcome to QCEC's documentation!
================================

QCEC is a tool for quantum circuit equivalence checking developed by the `Institute for Integrated Circuits <https://iic.jku.at/eda/>`_ at the `Johannes Kepler University Linz <https://jku.at>`_ and the Chair for Design Automation at the `Technical University of Munich <https://www.tum.de/>`_.

QCEC is part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (formerly known as JKQ :cite:labelpar:`wille2020JKQtools`).
It builds upon `our quantum functionality representation (QFR) <https://github.com/cda-tum/qfr>`_ and `our decision diagram (DD) package <https://github.com/cda-tum/dd_package.git>`_.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us via `iic-quantum@jku.at <mailto:iic-quantum@jku.at>`_ or by creating an issue on `GitHub <https://github.com/cda-tum/qcec/issues>`_.
